Modular Router
--------------

A smart package for the Meteor framework using visionmedia's page.js to enable
program structure and function changes based on URL segments.

Although heavily inspired by Tom Coleman's meteor-router, this router differs in
that its sole responsibility is to send out commands in the form of JavaScript
Objects using amplify's publish subscribe mechanism.

This code is not intended for production. It's main purpose is to serve as test
code for sketching out how one might introduce page routing to Meteor.
